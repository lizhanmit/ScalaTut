# Scala Tutorial

### Variables

In functional programming language, it is encouraged to use immutable constants whenever possible. In Scala, use `val` as possible as you can rather that `var`.

### Console Input & Output

Need `import io.StdIn._` before using it.

- `readInt`
- `readDouble`
- `readByte`
- `readShort`
- `readFloat`
- `readLong`
- `readChar`
- `readBoolean`
- `readLine`: can have a parameter as prompt.
